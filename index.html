                                Learn Care Share, a non-profit foundation was
                                initiated to educate and propagate the rich

                                foundation has since expanded and evolved into
                                several new realms such as education for the

                        Learn Care Share was founded in San Francisco as a
                        platform for discussion and propagation of the rich
                        Bengali culture and ethnic diversity. We believe in the
                        importance of cultural consciousness in the youth of the
                        nation and aimed to create a medium through which people
                        could gain a more holistic understanding of the rich
                        Bengali history. Through discussions of art,language and
                        music we wanted to engage our future generations to
                        remain attuned to their roots regardless of wherever
                        they are. Over the years we diversified our interests
                        and delved into more relevant socio-economic causes such
                        as educational and financial aid to the underprivileged
                        sections of the society.
