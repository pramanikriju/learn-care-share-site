                        Amphan,a storm surge of 16ft (5m) flooded several areas
                        of India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka etc and over 1 million
                        homes were damaged just in the state of West Bengal. In
                        India, the state government estimated approximately ₹1
                        trillion ($13.2 billion) in damage which directly
                        affected 70 percent of the state's population. State
                        officials described the storm's effects there as worse
                        than that of COVID-19.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We are seeking donations to provide relief to the people
                        who have been severely affected by the storm. All of the
                        proceeds will go to Rotary District 3291 and the
                        Bimalendu Ghosh Foundation. Rotary 3291 is the offshoot
                        the Rotary International in Kolkata. We aim to provide
                        clean water, food, and medical care to the impoverished
                        population of West Bengal. The Bimalendu Ghosh
                        Foundation is a nonprofit organization based in India
                        focused on helping underprivileged women and girls to
                        develop their skills and escape poverty and work towards
                        a lucrative future. All of the monetary aid raised will
                        be donated to these foundations.

                    <h2>Teaching</h2>
                    <p>
                        With the organization’s mission in mind, we strive to
                        find new ways to educate students during the COVID-19
                        pandemic. We specialize in a variety of subjects,
                        including math, chemistry, biology, physics, spanish and
                        english. These subjects are taught by high school
                        students who are interested in these subjects and want
                        to pursue them in the future. Our sessions are
                        one-on-one so that we can tailor the curriculum based on
                        the needs of each student. Education should be available
                        to everyone, despite any circumstance. Therefore, our
                        hourly prices are little to none.
