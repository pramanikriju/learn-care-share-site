                        A storm surge of 16ft (5m) flooded the area, and over 1
                        million homes were damaged just in the state of West
                        Bengal. The state government estimated that the storm
                        caused at least ₹1 trillion ($13.2 billion) in damage
                        and directly affected 70 percent of the state's
                        population. State officials described the storm's
                        effects there as worse than that of COVID-19.

                    <p>
                        We are seeking donations to provide relief to those
                        affected by this destructive storm. All of the proceeds
                        will go to Rotary District 3291 and the Bimalendu Ghosh
                        Foundation. Rotary 3291 is the Kolkata branch of the
                        Rotary International. Its goal is to provide clean
                        water, food, and medical care to the impoverished
                        population of West Bengal. The Bimalendu Ghosh
                        Foundation is an India based nonprofit organization
                        focused on helping underprivileged women and girls
                        develop skills and escape poverty. All of the money
                        raised will be donated to these foundations, and the
                        money will be used to provide clean water, medical
                        services, food, and shelter to those affected by the
                        storm.

                        Tutoring kids Grades 5-8 With our organization’s mission
                        always in mind, we strive to find new ways to educate
                        students during the COVID-19 pandemic. We specialize in
                        a variety of subjects, including math, chemistry,
                        biology, physics, Spanish, and English. These subjects
                        are taught by high school students who are interested in
                        these subjects and want to pursue them further. Our
                        sessions are one-on-one so that we can tailor the
                        curriculum based on the needs of each student. Education
                        should be available to everyone, despite any
                        circumstance. Therefore, our hourly prices are little to
                        none.
